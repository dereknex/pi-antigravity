All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-19

### Performance

- **Fast Time-to-First-Token (TTFT):** Bypassed pre-flight model discovery round-trips for known static models (`gemini-3.7-flash`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, etc.), immediately sending streaming requests with verified runtime IDs and falling back to dynamic lookup only when needed.
- **Fast-path endpoint discovery:** Updated model discovery to prioritize the primary production endpoint and return immediately upon match, eliminating latency stalls from slower sandbox endpoints.
- **Parallelized usage & quota fetch:** `fetchAccountUsage()` now runs `loadCodeAssist`, `retrieveUserQuotaSummary`, and `fetchMergedAvailableModels` concurrently in a single `Promise.all()`, roughly halving `/antigravity.usage` execution time.

### Fixed

- **Turn alternation & message merge:** Automatically merge consecutive same-role messages (`user` or `model`) and guarantee initial user turn in `convertMessages()`, preventing 400 Bad Request multi-turn errors from Google Cloud Code Assist.
- **Base64 image Data URLs:** Sanitize image data by stripping `data:...;base64,` prefixes and auto-detecting MIME types in `asTextParts()` to prevent image payload rejection by Gemini.
- **Tool schema `$ref` dereferencing:** Inlined local `$defs` / `definitions` in tool schemas before meta keyword stripping, preventing dangling `$ref` schema errors on complex custom tools.
- **OAuth server socket cleanup:** Added friendly `EADDRINUSE` messaging for port 51121 and called `server.closeAllConnections()` for immediate socket teardown upon sign-in completion.

### Diagnostics

- **Latency & Doctor enhancements:** Added `lastLatencyMs` to `/antigravity.doctor` and introduced a safe `maskEmail` utility.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-16

### Performance

- **Parallelized model discovery:** `fetchAvailableRuntimeModel` probed 2 endpoints × 3 request-body variants sequentially (up to 6 awaited round-trips) on every cache miss before a generation request could even start. Fired concurrently instead, and removed two variants that were provably dead weight — one always returned a 400 (`cloudaicompanionProject` isn't a real field on this endpoint) and one was byte-identical to another. Measured against the live backend: cold model discovery down from ~3.6s to ~1.4s (2.5x), and the full cold-start setup path (token refresh + discovery) down from ~5.8s to ~1.1s (5.2x).
- **Skip redundant project discovery on token refresh:** `refreshAntigravityToken` always called `loadCodeAssist` even though its cache is keyed by token and a refresh always mints a new one, guaranteeing a wasted round-trip. Now skipped whenever the credentials already carry a `projectId` (the normal case).
- **Longer caches:** model-discovery and project-id caches extended from 10/5 minutes to 30 minutes, so the (now much cheaper) cold path is hit a third as often.
- **Parallelized `/antigravity.usage` and `/antigravity.models`:** merged model-catalog fetch across endpoints concurrently instead of sequentially, and dropped the same dead request-body variant.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-08-15

### Documentation

- **README & Security Polish:** Reorganized documentation with a table of contents, clear onboarding structure, detailed breakdown of required OAuth scopes in a reference table, and updated security policy.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- **Gemini 3.7 Flash runtime routing:** Route every displayed effort through the live `gemini-3.7-flash-tiered` runtime and send Low, Medium, or High via `generationConfig.thinkingConfig`. Add the `aicode` OAuth scope used by the current Antigravity CLI so future logins receive the complete model catalog.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Gemini 3.7 Flash Support:** Added public model `gemini-3.7-flash` with Low, Medium, and High thinking-effort routing to `gemini-3.7-flash-low|medium|high` and 65,536 output token budget.
- **Graceful Runtime Fallback:** Added automatic runtime candidate fallback (e.g. falling back to Gemini 3.6 Flash when 3.7 Flash is requested before backend deployment/activation) to prevent 404 stream rejections during server-side model rollouts.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Gemini 3.7 Flash Support:** Added public model `gemini-3.7-flash` with Low, Medium, and High thinking-effort routing to `gemini-3.7-flash-low|medium|high` and 65,536 output token budget.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- **Claude/GPT tool schema 400s:** Normalize custom-tool bridge schemas with an allowlist (`type`, `description`, `properties`, `required`, `items`, `enum`) instead of a denylist, so keywords like `nullable` and JSON Schema type unions (`["string","null"]`) no longer trigger `Unknown name` / Invalid JSON payload rejections from Cloud Code Assist.
- **Request-format error diagnostics:** Include the backend rejection message in friendly 400 errors so the unknown field is visible without digging through raw API responses.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- **Maximum Output Token Limit (#6):** Default `maxOutputTokens` request budget now uses the model's full verified maximum output capacity instead of an arbitrary 8192-token fallback limit, preventing premature completion cut-offs on long responses. Added request-side token clamping matching exact backend per-runtime limits (65,536 for Gemini 3.6/3.5 Flash, 65,535 for Gemini 3.1 Pro, 64,000 for Claude Opus/Sonnet, 32,768 for GPT-OSS 120B) to prevent 400 Bad Request errors when caller options exceed model ceilings.
- **Thinking Model Accessibility & Routing (#7):** Added unit regression tests ensuring all public model IDs and thinking levels expose backend-supported routing and hiding unavailable levels. Recorded live model map keys and display labels across all advertised efforts.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-07-23

### Performance

- Skip redundant `loadCodeAssist` HTTP call per inference when credentials already carry a project ID.
- Cache `fetchAvailableRuntimeModel` results for 10 minutes, eliminating 2–6 repeated HTTP calls on every stream request.
- Rewrite SSE stream parser to use index-based scanning instead of `split('\n')`, removing per-chunk array allocations.
- Consolidate `loadCodeAssist` in `/antigravity.usage`: reuse a single response for both project ID resolution and tier info, and run quota summary fetch in parallel.
- Replace O(n) `projectCache` eviction with O(1) LRU (insertion-order delete).

## [0.2.3] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- Show only the thinking levels supported by each Antigravity model instead of every Pi level.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Gemini 3.6 Flash (`gemini-3.6-flash`) with Low/Medium/High thinking-effort routing to `gemini-3.6-flash-low|medium|high`.

### Changed

- Runtime model discovery keeps searching endpoint candidates so daily/sandbox-only models (currently 3.6 Flash) resolve correctly.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Isolated per-request diagnostics and the `/antigravity.doctor` command for sanitized provider troubleshooting.
- Coverage for model routing, tool-schema normalization, stable project IDs, and Claude tool-call conversion.

### Changed

- Split the provider into focused auth, client, diagnostics, models, streaming, types, usage, and utility modules.
- Made project-ID fallback stable per authenticated account instead of depending on the local working directory.
- Clarified OAuth client behavior and how to use a custom Google Cloud OAuth client.
- Bumped the package version to 0.2.0.

### Security

- Centralized API endpoint validation, callback loopback enforcement, and diagnostic secret redaction.
